There are different types of network present in different Books.Like LAN, MAN, PAN, WAN.... etc..
This So Called Network types are teached by college professors. But I am going to show you how actually types of network(LAN WAN) are used practically.

## 1. LAN 
- Local Area Network
- If your devices are connected to each other with wire or wireless without connecting to internet then this network is LAN.
- LAN Network works on <b>Private IP</b>
- Keep in Mind Network connectivity that involves internet then network become WAN.
- LAN are high speed and most secure.

## 2. WAN
