# Forward and Reverse Proxy
## Forward proxy
- A forward proxy is a server that sits between user devices and the internet.
- A forward proxy is commonly used for: 
1. Protect clients
2. Avoid browsing restrictions
3. Block access to certain content

## Reverse proxy
- A reverse proxy is a server that accepts a request from the client, forwards the request to web servers, and returns the results to the client as if the proxy server had processed the request.
- A reverse proxy is good for:
1. Protect servers
2. Load balancing
3. Cache static contents
4. Encrypt and decrypt SSL communications
