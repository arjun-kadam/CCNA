## Transmission Modes
- Transmission mode means transforming of data of between two devices.
- Types of Transmission Mode 
   1) Simplex Mode
   2) Half Duplex Mode 
   3) Full Duplex Mode

## 1. Simplex Mode 
- Communication is unidirectional.
- Only one devices on a link can transmit the other can only receive
- Eg. Keyboard, FM Receiver.

- Capacity of the link is share among two i.e If Channel has 2Mbps Capacity then this capcity is split into 1Mbps on both Devices.
- Eg. Telephone
