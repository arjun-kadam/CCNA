# Network Topology
- Network topology means how devices are connected to each other.
- Physical Topology : Actual layout of the how computers connected with each other by using cables.
- Logical Topology : The way actually devices communicate internally.

## Mesh Topology
- Each computer connects to every other computer.
- High level of redundancy.
- Popular in LAN.
- Wiring is complicated.

## Bus Topology
- Uses a trunk or backbone to which all of the computers on network to connect
- System is connected to this backbone using T-connector.
- Require less cable.
- Does not use any specialized network device.
- All nodes gets information sent.
- Break in cable, entitr network goes down.

## Star Topology
- Mostly Used Topology.
- All computers/devices connect to central devices called hub or switch.
- Each device requires a single cable point-to-point connection between the device & hub.
Cable failure affects only single user.
- Easy to Troubleshoot.
- Easy to add new device.

## Ring Topology
- Data travel in circular fashion from one computer to another on network.
- Ring Network are most commonly wired in Physical star configuration.
- Due to token,avoid collision.

## Hybrid Topology 
- It is the combination of two or more topologies.

## Tree Toplogy
- Combination of star & bus topologies.
- This topology is an extension of the bus & star topologies.
new nodes can be easily added.
